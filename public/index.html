      <p>
        This is a simple HTTP REST API designed to act as a news server, in
        which clients are able to interact with. You can filter articles by
        existing topics, sort them by: title, when they were published, upvotes
        or comment count in ascending or descending order. Comments can be
        retrieved on individual articles, new comments can be posted or deleted
        by the registered user.
